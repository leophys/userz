# How to modify/extend this microservice

## Store

### SQL

Prerequisites to be installed to develop on the store:
  - [go-migrate][gm]
  - [sqlc][sqlc]

#### Migrations

To add a migration run, in `./store/pg/`, the following:

```
migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations -seq <migration-name>
```

This will create two files `NNNNNN_<migration-name>.{up,down}.sql`. You have to
edit the files and add the SQL statements you want the automation to run at
startup, and the corresponding statements to revert the migration.

#### Queries and statements

The golang implementation of queries and statements are generated by
[sqlc][sqlc]. To add or modify them, you have to modify `./store/pg/queries.sql`
and then run, from the same directory, `go generate`. The resulting
implementation will be in `./store/pg/postgres`.
